const e=`## Overview
Echo is the High Priestess of the Arcana, and wielder of the Bow relic. During the Fall, she and Silver were cursed by Kamui, had their memories wiped, and sent 1,000 years into the future. 
Echo is gung-ho and impulsive, her fighting style relying on daggers, agile motions, and quick swapping using the Lovers relic.

## Relic
#### The Bow
The Bow is the signature Relic of the High Priestess. In it's prime, the Bow can be used to copy any relic, magic, or glyph the wielder desires. Before Echo regains her memories, the copy ability can only be used subconsciously in moments of extreme stress.
The Relic can also be used as a standard bow for long range combat.

## Abilities
#### Time Control
Due to Dagon's curse, if Echo ever dies, time will be rewound to when she first woke up. 


## Notes and Trivia
- Echo is one of three characters who can theoretically use every relic, the other two being Silver and Anubis.
- The title "The Echo Effect" is actually based off of Echo (combined with "The Butterfly Effect").`;export{e as default};
