## Curse
The Glyph of Mana Control

## Relic
#### The Book
The Book is the signature Relic of the Magician. Under Melody's control, it can absorb a limitless amount of magical power in exchange for information. Because the Book cannot be overloaded, this allows it to be used to siphon off Melody's immense magical reserves at no risk to the surrounding environment. This effect is only active when the Book is open.

## Abilities
#### Magical Reserves
Melody's magical power generation surpasses all known limits. Without a proper conduit for using the magic, it will build up and run haywire.

#### Defense Projection
A series of magical shields and barriers that are impenetrable by most weapons and abilities. These can be created
on a large-scale, such as the barrier surrounding the Starting Village, or on a small scale, such as the shields she uses during combat.

#### Spatial Control
The highest level movement technique, allowing the user to instantaneously teleport to a location at will. Melody can use this to travel anywhere in her sightlines, or to any location she has been before.

#### Memory Manipulation
Used on Echo to implant a fabricated history at the Starting Village. These memories begin to deteriorate with after Melody's death.

#### Sentient Illusions
Used at the **Starting Village** to create the villagers. This illusion fades with her death.
