const e=`## Overview
Pandora is the current Devil of the Arcana, and wielder of the Weapon relic. Her speciality is as the Arcana's weapon master, making her profficient in all forms of fighting.  
During the 1,000 year timeskip, Pandora is seen hunting many low-level demons. This does not result in the transference of any additional Glyphs, but does add to her soul count, further increasing her madness.

## Curse
The Glyph of Spirits. All souls reaped by Pandora are hers to control, but will also haunt her. The Box was implemented as a preventative measure to hold the spirits at bay, mitigating but not fully containing them. 


## Motivation
Being haunted by the Curse, combined with the continuous demon hunting has left Pandora in a state of madness, driving her to destroy everything she can. 
Before the Awakening, Pandora cannot break through the magical shield surrounding the Village, putting her and Melody in a standstill. After Narcissus is defeated, Pandora is able to trick Silver into opening the Box, giving her the strength boost needed to break through the barrier.    


## Relic
#### The Weapon
The Weapon is the signature Relic of the Devil. While originally taking the form of a large black scythe, the Relic can instantaneously change shape to fit the user's needs. This includes swords, daggers, hammers, quarterstaffs, and chakrams. Even outside of its base form, the Weapon Relic will maintain an ethereal black glow that differentiates it from a physical weapon. 

## Abilities
#### Disguise
Prior to the invasion of the Village, Pandora disguises herself as Lyna to run reconnaissance. This disguise will go so far as to alter her magical footprint, making her invisible to Melody. 

#### Underworld Army
After opening the Box and unleashing the spirits of the Underworld, Pandora gains limited control over them, and can direct their movements and focus their intent. 


## Notes and Trivia
- Pandora's name cannot be revealed until after the Box is open, as the term "Pandora's Box" would tip the player off that it should not be opened. `;export{e as default};
