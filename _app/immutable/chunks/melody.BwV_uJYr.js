## History
#### Before the Fall
#### Fall of the Arcana
#### Fall of Babylon
Hours after the Fall, Melody remarks that Hammurabi would have been able to help, had he still been alive. Narcissus points out that Hammurabi is still alive, but nobody has seen him in years. Melody, surprised by this, picks up Astreus and teleports to Babylon's throne room. Sitting on the throne, is Hammurabi. Melody confronts Hammurabi, questioning where he was when the village was under attack. He retorts by claiming that the village should have been able to defend itself; Anyone who died in Dagon's attack was simply too weak to be called an Arcana. Enraged by this, Melody closes the Book, activating False Transcendence, and attacks Hammurabi, destroying the throne room in the process. The battle leaves Hammurabi out cold on the floor with Melody as the decisive victor. Picking up the broken Spear, Melody denounces Hammurabi as the Emperor and leaves.
