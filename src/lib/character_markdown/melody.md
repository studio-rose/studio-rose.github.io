## History
#### Before the Fall
History unknown. I have a few ideas related to the Angels, but as it currently stands, her history begins with the Arcana. 

#### Fall of the Arcana
During the Fall, Melody fought alongside the remaining 6 Arcana warriors. For more details, see (The Fall).

#### Fall of Babylon
Hours after the Fall, Melody remarks that Hammurabi would have been able to help, had he still been alive. Narcissus 
points out that Hammurabi is still alive, but nobody has seen him in years. Melody, surprised by this, picks up 
Astreus and teleports to Babylon's throne room. Sitting on the throne, is Hammurabi. Melody confronts Hammurabi, 
questioning where he was when the village was under attack. He retorts by claiming that the village should have been 
able to defend itself; Anyone who died in Dagon's attack was simply too weak to be called an Arcana. Enraged by this,
Melody closes the Book, activating Akashic Collapse, and attacks Hammurabi, destroying the throne room in the process. 
The battle leaves Hammurabi out cold on the floor with Melody as the decisive victor. Picking up the broken Spear, Melody denounces Hammurabi as the Emperor and leaves.

## Abilities
#### Magical Reserves
Melody's magical power generation surpasses all known limits. Without a proper conduit for using the magic, it will build up and run haywire. 

#### Relic Mastery
The Book is the signature Relic of the Magician. Under Melody's control, it can absorb a limitless amount of magical power in exchange for information. Because the Book cannot be overloaded, this allows it to be used to siphon off Melody's immense magical reserves at no risk to the surrounding environment. This effect is only active when the Book is open. 

#### Defense Projection
A series of magical shields and barriers that are impenetrable by most weapons and abilities. These can be created 
on a large-scale, such as the barrier surrounding the Starting Village, or on a small scale, such as the shields she uses during combat.

#### Spatial Control
The highest level movement technique, allowing the user to instantaneously teleport to a location at will. Melody can use this to travel anywhere in her sightlines, or to any location she has been before. 

#### Memory Manipulation
Used on Echo to implant a fabricated history at the Starting Village. These memories begin to deteriorate with after Melody's death.

#### Sentient Illusions
Used at the **Starting Village** to create the villagers. This illusion fades with her death. 


## Notes and Trivia
- When Echo was awakened, Melody instill a memory of being her sister. In reality, the two do not share any familial ties. 
- Melody possesses the most magic out of any known character, including the Demons. Despite this, she would only fight when it is an absolute necessity.
