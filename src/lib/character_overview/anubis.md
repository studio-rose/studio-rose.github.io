## Overview
Anubis is the 5th member of the Arcana, holder of the Judgement tarot and wielder of the Scales relic. He has a short stature, a wispy black cloak, and wears a decorative wolf/jackal mask at all times. 
During the prime age of the Arcana, Anubis was commonly referred to as the second weakest Arcana. His appearance and behavior aims to mimic the cool sternness of Narcissus, but often comes across as edgy. 
After the Fall, Anubis fled to the Underworld, where he lived in solitude.

## Curse
The Glyph of the Underworld
- Cursed to be forgotten over time?
- Cursed to spread death aura?
- Cursed to wear the mask?

## Abilities
#### Shadow Manipulation
Anubis can freely control shadows to manifest as physical tendrils. These tentacles can function as appendages which pierce, grab, and block attacks. The physical strength of these tendrils is directly tied to Anubis's magical stamina. In addition, he can transform his own body into shadow to become intangible and quickly travel through any connected shadows.

#### Final Omen: Judgement
An instant-kill move that can only be used under very specific circumstances (list here). This move is used to transport Echo and Silver to the Underworld in Cycle 7

## Notes and Trivia
- Under Anubis's mask is a second, identical, mask.
- Out of all of the Arcana, Anubis is the least driven by his curse to kill Echo and Silver. His desire to kill becomes a personal vendetta after learning of the other Arcanas' demise.
